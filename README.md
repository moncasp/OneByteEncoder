# OneByteEncoder

## Motivation
Writing a tool to encrypt files with a simple encryption algorithm for Malware Developers. Each byte of the file is xor with another key. You can include it in your own project in two different versions as C ++ and python.

## How To Work

The first entered key is the first byte of the target file and the xor is the result, the key value for the next byte. This file lasts until the end.
